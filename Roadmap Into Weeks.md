<h1 align="center">Roadmap Into Weeks </h1> 

  
 ## It's the same roadmap, but divided into weeks with an average studying rate of 6 hours per week. 
  
 ### This roadmap is divided into 4 stages: 
 ### 1. Stage 1: you get a basic understanding of the prerequisites, data cleaning, and git. 
 ### 2. Stage 2: learn visualizing, Tableau, SQL, and web scraping. 
 ### 3. Stage 3: dive into ML and Math 
 ### 4. Stage 4: where we learn DL, CV, and NLP. 
 
 <br> 
 
 > You should make a task after each week, and some projects after each stage.
